This is a test post written while building this blog using cinnog.

Right now it's just pointing to some other cool resources.

Checkout:
- [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/), an awesome f
- [Cinnog](https://github.com/NiklasEi/cinnog), a tool for using leptos to do Static Site Generation. It's still in very early stages, but it's very cool.
- Cinnog uses the awesome [Bevy Entity Component System](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/ecs/) as the data layer. It's a really cool system and worth checking out, even if you aren't interested in game development. As Cinnog shows, it has lots of applications outside of that.
